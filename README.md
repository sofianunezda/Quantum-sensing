## 📖 Study Manual

This repository includes a complete introductory manual on quantum sensing based on NV centers in diamond, written during my research internship at the Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology Research Center (CINN).

The manual covers the physical principles of NV centers, ODMR, microwave instrumentation, radiofrequency generators and spectrum analyzers, serving as a practical introduction to NV-based quantum sensing.

## Overview

This repository contains my study notes, technical documentation and educational material related to quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond.

The project was developed during my summer research internship at the Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology Research Center (CINN), where I am studying the fundamentals of quantum sensing, microwave instrumentation and ODMR (Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance).

Besides theoretical material, the repository includes an interactiva Python program tha simulates ODMR spectra under different experimental conditions and reconstructs the external magnetic field from the resonance frequencies.
